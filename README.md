# Writing PoCs for processor software side-channels

Talk will briefly explain previously related work of L1TF vulnerability and how writing proof-of-concepts is actually the least fun part of processor software side-channels. Techniques and methodologies will be shared that led to discovery of MDS (Microarchitectural Data Sampling) vulnerabilities CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091. What one should pay attention to and how understanding of results and its validation is the most important factor.

# Mess with the best, die like the rest (mode)

This presentation will talk about how custom Southbridge silicon, responsibe for background downloads while main SoC is off, didnâ€™t help to secure Playstation 4. It will explain how a chain of exploits combined with hardware attacks will allow code to run in the context of the secure bootloader, extract private keys, and sign a custom kernel.
